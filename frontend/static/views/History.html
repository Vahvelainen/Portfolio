  <h3>Founding and leading startup named Menddie.com</h3>
  <p class="years">2020-2021</p>
  <p>
    Could I really build something of my own if I wanted? Based on a course-work, I founded a repair service platform company. 
    We build a team, and a product and were able to rise 100Kâ‚¬ funding from Finnish angel investors. 
    We did get buch of very lovely customers but sadly, the business side weren't that succesfull I decided to return to study.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned so much about building digital services and entrepreneurship that I can proudly say it was a two years well spend.

  <h3>Carpentry jobs & Military service</h3>
  <p class="years">2015 - 2017</p>
  <p>
    Even though I received a study place in aalto in 2015, my obligatory military service 
    in 2016 forced me to lay back my studies for few years. I used my time in between doing 
    carpenter jobs from furniture to renovating for city of Helsinki. I mostly did small 
    orders for specific needs in schools and daycare centers where I had the freedom to plan 
    my own work.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the military service I ended up in leader training in reserve officer school (RUK) 
    and onward to train the next batch of leaders. Here I found interest towards the 
    fundamentals of leading people.
