<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  Here is what I've done before in life
</p>

<h3>Design studies at Aalto University</h3>
<p class="years">2017-</p>
<p>
  I'm currently studying my bachelor degree in design at Aalto University. 
  It is here where I got to known the variety of possibilities with design activity 
  and deepened my interest towards the subject.
</p>
<p>
  I have also been active in community with different student associations like 
  Aalto entrepreneurship society and the student organisation of the department of design.
</p>

<h3>Carpentry jobs & Military service</h3>
<p class="years">2015 - 2017</p>
<p>
  Even though I received a study place in aalto in 2015, my obligatory military service 
  in 2016 forced me to lay back my studies for few years. I used my time in between doing 
  carpenter jobs from furniture to renovating for city of Helsinki. I mostly did small 
  orders for specific needs in schools and daycare centers where I had the freedom to plan 
  my own work.
</p>
<p>
  During the military service I ended up in leader training in reserve officer school (RUK) 
  and onward to train the next batch of leaders. Here I found interest towards the 
  fundamentals of leading people.
</p>

<h3>Wood artisan degree</h3>
<p class="years">2012 - 2015</p>
<p>
  When I was younger my interest towards crafts got me to study woodworking. 
  Besides crafts, the degree included product design basics and learning to consider efficient manufacturing. 
  It was here where I interested about product development and decided to apply into Aalto 
  University to study design.
