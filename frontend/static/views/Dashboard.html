<p class="subtitle">Designer</p>
<p>
  Four years old, me who carved a new fish club for his grandpa could 
  not foresee the challenges and projects I later encountered and I 
  believe I won't never stop marvel the opportunities that life throws at me.
</p>
<p>My lifelong interest of designing things has finally got me to a point 
  where I can do interesting projects for my life's work.
