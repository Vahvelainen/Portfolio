<h1>Menddie.com</h1>

<p>
  Menddie is an ecommerce platform for repair services. More precisely, a marketplace for tailors and sewing services to sell repairs for clothing items, with online payment and delivery both ways from customer to service providers and back.
</p>

<p>
  The platform had all the functionalities expected from an online marketplace. Customers could choose between pre-listed repair prices or as a quote for more complicated jobs. 
</p>

<p>
  Menddie is an startup founded originally by Leevi Vahvelainen and Henri Kämäräinen in late 2019. Leevi did the design work for the platform and the service, while Henri focussed the business side. Later additions to the developing team where Elias Ojala and Simo Naatula, both doing software development.

<h2>Key features the platform included:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Service providers listings with additional options </li>
    <li>Smart categorisation for repair-jobs</li>
    <li>Quote asking system between customers and service providers</li>
    <li>Cart and checkout experience</li>
    <li>Immediate delivery code after purchase</li>
    <li>Service provider feedback and ratings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pre-priced repairs:</h2>

<p>The first and arguably the more important feature of the online buying experience. The very first challenge in listing repair prices was the way they need to be categorized. The solution was structured in the same way as a discussion with a tailor.</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is it that you have?</li>
    <li>What&#39;s broken with it?</li>
    <li>How do you want it to be fixed?</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>The first iteration of the platform did not have options for different repairs but that part later became the point where customers could choose between different service providers.</p>

<h2>Asking for a quote.</h2>
  
<p>Originally developed to gain information about what is missing from the listings, free way to ask for quotes from the service providers proved to be an excellent way for more unique repair jobs out there.</p>

<p>Customers would simply leave a request and in the time span of three days they would get offers to their emails with a direct link to gon and purchase too offered repair.</p>

<p>The system was streamline a couple limitations.</p>
<p>Customers couldn&rsquo;t ask for a direct price but they had an option to determine a price range of either less than 50&euro; or less than 100&euro; inorder to give service providers and idea of the price sensitivity of the customer</p>
<p>Later, the maximum amount of quotes per request was reduced to three, so as to not bother service providers.</p>
